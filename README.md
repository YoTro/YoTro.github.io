## Get started
When I was a freshman, C is my first compute program."Holle world!" make firend with me.His grammer is so rigorous,the pointer can access the upper and lower layers.It's so perfect!  
Then I got in touch with C++,sql,html,css,linux...
I had built a website with centOS,his <strong>yum</strong> is as beautiful as <strong>apt-get</strong>.

## Try you beat
Not any thing you do would be success,but if you not do!  
You've got to have a dream.

## The end
Hopefully wee will be better tomorrow !
