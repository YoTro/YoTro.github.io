On May 20th, it can be said that 520 is an important day for many couples to date, but for me it is a day to leave office.

In fact, I already felt that when on May, but it was still a bit too sudden, although I have already prepared.

Perhaps it is a relief to both sides, although have regret, after all, spent time on it. It’s still right for ace, no matter how busy the work is, try to spend more than an hour to enrich yourself and keep learning so that you can reduce external risks. 

This resignation also reminded me that it is a turning point in my life. I didn't dare to take too much duty in the past. 

Now I find that I seem to be more brave, because the experience of failure will make you successful, as long as you persist in not being discouraged.

5月20号，可以说520是众多情侣约会的重要日子，但是对于我来说却是离职的日子。

其实在5月份到来时我就有这种感觉了，只不过来的有点太突然，虽然心里已然有了心里准备。

或许对双方都是一种解脱吧，尽管有些遗憾，毕竟花了些许心思在上面。还是大牛说的对，不管工作有多忙，尽量还是多出一个小时的时间充实自己，不断学习，这样才能降低外部风险。这次的离职也提醒了我，算是一种人生转折点。以前觉得不敢承担太多，现在发现我好像勇敢许多，因为失败的经历反而会促使你成功，只要你一直坚持不气馁。
