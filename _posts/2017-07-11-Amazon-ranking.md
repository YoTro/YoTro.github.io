This summer I go to Zhejiang do my first job in E-commerce.My first stage is Amazon which is the one of lagrgest E-stage in the world focus on listing not store. 
So if your products is premiun, you could only focus on listing and customer service.But the listing is a complex technology work.The search term and title if make reasonable,could make your merchandises ranked very well.  

 
# Amazon ranking # 


The first thing we should know what is amazon ranking.  
Amazon's two top rankings:Searhing rankings and Category rankings.  
Generally the top rank are must be Amazon store and the sellers who slect of Amazon logistics distribution.  
This is a big proportion,which have buying habits with Amazon users.Most user of Amazon are accustomed to using cash on delivery functions,and Amazon has been marketing his own Amazon logistics user experience.It has long encourged the third party warehousing and  using the Amazon logistics that do FBA(fullfill by Amazon) order.So Amazon will support Amazon logistics products in search rankings.

You could see it has *Beauty & Personal Care* which is first class.It have mulit-level categories.Each category has a Top 100 ranking,you should know what is the market saturation of each category,and you need to be know clearly Market share of each brand in this category,their price.
## Search rankings ##  
When you want to buy products in Amazon,you would search words.Then There are many products in the webpage you can choice.The rank is as important as category ranking in Amazon.So it is about search term and listing.  
[A9](https://www.a9.com/) which is a search engine of Amazon.It's introduce in official website is 
```If you've done a search on Amazon, you've used the A9 Product Search engine.
```
So What are its considerations?  

1.Percent conversion of Listing

2.Listing hits

3.Correlation of Listing

4.Account weights and performance

5.Review/Q&A

6.other..


Generally,a new good has no a chance go to first search webpage,because it dose not have one of these factors.  
So what can we do if you are new seller?  
That depends on the keyword settings and your listing.
