The Listing page shows the second only to the title and pictures in the rankings, which is the selling point of the product. From the layout of the Amazon page, we can generally know which specific link is more important in Amazon's eyes. Amazon has arranged the best product presentation for our sellers, which is one of the reasons why we should pay special attention to the "five major selling points" on the page. 


In the search for new products, we have already referred to the needs of the market, so I know the reason for this product. But as listing writers, consider more of what the buyer sees, not just the product itself. Although the product is to determine the selling point of reference important point, but how to describe the ability to seize the buyer's heart, is the most important thing listing writers should consider.

When writing a selling point, we can consider it from the following angles:


## the point of view ##


1.Attract buyers eye, stimulate demand for purchase.

Buyers to purchase products always "compare with other stores", showing different products to let buyers eyes more stay for you, the customer first glance, that is similar to the same information will generally not immediately tired.

Even if the product features are not different, you have to make "different". Of course, the buyer's `interest point` may not only be "different" bring, there can be many other points, but `difference` is to distinguish between your products and tens of millions of other sellers key.

2.Describe professional, brand / intimacy, lifestyle / easy to understand and so on.

The use of language as a medium of communication should be standardized on the platform, and special adjustments will be made to suit the customers. For some major products, customers need specialized description, so as to produce a sense of security products, will be assured to buy.

For some products, many times more annoying customer product description of the "professional, the term" language into the breath of life, can enhance product and customer intimacy, enhance the psychological expectations of customers for product. After the customer read your description as in the fog.

3.Dispel misgivings, prompting direct purchase.

After the seller made the above effort and raised the customer's interest to a certain extent, we need to further change the customer's interest from the idea into the actual purchasing behavior.

Sometimes, some inflammatory language will directly lead to the emergence of consumer behavior; sometimes, the seller's one or two sentence to meet the buyer's after-sale protection, but also to dispel doubts in the minds of customers.

4.To meet the algorithm, to enhance the rankings, exposure.

Listing page keywords, reasonable and appropriate embedding can make rankings rise. And selling points as an important part of listing, the introduction of keywords is essential.

## Preparation before writing ##

After knowing what effect our selling point should achieve, we can do the preparatory work of writing the selling point. At first we didn't know how to start, and with that, you'd know where to start organizing the language.

1.Familiar with the product: the biggest selling point, other features, the applicable crowd and the main use of scenes.

Upload products, for sellers, the biggest selling points are generally clear. Sometimes, in fact, the selling point of a product can not be confined to the product itself. It is necessary to describe the added value of the product from a deeper level, and this additional value is worthy of some psychological expectation of the purchaser.

In the new on-line, we have the best product has a clear positioning: product is faced with what kind of consumer groups, suitable for what kind of scene in use?.

Clear product positioning not only helps sellers to target specific groups, achieving the desired goals in the most direct way and fast in the shortest time, will have a clearer understanding to clear their position can be achieved.

2.Find out keywords: customer search frequently used keywords.

How to get keywords, there are many ways, not here one by one. The most appropriate way is that you can get the keywords from the customer's mouth from the review similar to the product. With keywords, we can put together other languages and enrich the whole sentence or image.

3.Language: localization, precise and brief, living and professional.
The localization degree of organization language is better, but the seller can reading smooth,  buyer usually understand easily.

Customers generally lack time to spend a lot of time on your page, and it's important to quickly navigate to the information you need. Sometimes, the aptly living language can quickly stimulate the buyer's inner need. In addition, it is better not to let customers at a glance that the seller is very amateur.

4.Product improvement, security and so on.

When the biggest selling point is displayed in the first place, we can also tap the various attributes of the product to distinguish customers from other brands.

For example, the lightning line, your coil is coarse and nylon woven, you can emphasize that the coarse coil and nylon knitting in the wire can help it to be durable and can be used for a long time without a bad one. From the characteristics of mining products and buyers meet the needs of the point.

5.The main competitors selling point analysis.

More research on competitors, similar products selling point is where to start, good, prominent place recorded. Finally integrated into their own language. Integration is not plagiarism, but optimization and innovation.

## Constantly optimize ##

After finishing, the seller noticed the effect is not ideal, he can often make changes. Of course, this cycle of change and patterns should be orderly, so that we can find out which one is really useful to us. For how to reasonably confirm the optimization point can achieve the effect, we can do this:

1. In the case of listing has been uploaded, download the sales report background, observe the average daily conversion rate of A1.

2. The optimization of a point, in other conditions (rest, holiday ,activities, etc.) have not been modified or changed little under the premise of the situation, choose at least 7 days (of course, the longer the better), the background download data to observe the average conversion rate of A2 every day.

3. Contrasted with A1 and A2 ,you coould found that even if the rise of 1 percentage points, it's shows that you did the optimization have effective, and vice versa.

How to optimize the way? Some sellers after update the product do not know how to optimize, the following tips can be properly used:

1. Analyzing major competitors selling point, choose right for you to modify.

2. Collect keywords which customers search for common , record keyword which have good effect in PPC.

3. In the sentence description, the language is localized, life oriented, streamlined and optimized.

4. Review/feedback, the product's outstanding which is involved in communication (selling, life scenes etc.)

5. Join the brand slogan (need long-term accumulated, for new sellers will sacrifice a lot earlier. For example, the first sentence of the Anker product is always the "The Anker Advantage: Join the million+ technology. powered by our leading")

## Points of attention ##


Customer psychology is more difficult to get, we have to do is to meet the needs of most people, reasonable abandon is also essential.

The following text on the product selling point may help you:

1. the first selling point is to pay attention to the most attractive point of the customer, directly distinguish between other products, stimulate the desire to buy. You can write about the biggest features of the product.

2. Other selling points can write other different features of the product, such as from the appearance, design structure, additional features, etc. can also be different. But when you don't have anything to write about, you can use one or two sentences to simplify and summarize all the points of your product, add the language of specialization, life, and the language itself can be a selling point.

3. For new concept products or products with unique additional functions, the one or two sentence points out its characteristics, and then briefly pointed out how to use.

4. Sometimes to highlight product features, an image of the specific effects of the product can stimulate buyers' interest more.

5. The product features are not obvious, from its applicable scene, scope of application, applicable to the crowd, etc., outline the overall use of the product.

6. Five selling points, the overall words of the specifications at a glance, some letters capitalized prominent, vivid language localization, for the conversion rate of the page has unexpected good results.

7. The last selling point, generally written to promote buyers to put aside scruples, direct purchase of sentences. When there is nothing to write, enclose shelf life, gifts, etc..
